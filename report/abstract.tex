\begin{abstract}
Attaining optimal program performance on modern heterogeneous hardware requires specializing compiler optimizations to individual architectures. To ease the 
engineering burden, researchers have proposed automatically learning optimal orderings of compiler optimization passes. In this work, we minimize IR instruction
count by ordering LLVM optimization passes with deep Q-learning, a standard reinforcement learning method. We attain an TODO\% reduction in instruction count 
compared to \texttt{-O0} (\% regression from \texttt{-Oz}) across six representative benchmark suites.
