\section{Future Work}

\subsection{CompilerGym}

We encountered numerous problems with the CompilerGym framework that should be fixed to support future research. In particular, the library version should 
be bumped, race conditions caused by multiprocessing should be eliminated, compilation should be parallelized, and the performance of built-in program 
representations such as inst2vec should be improved, 

\subsection{Program Representation}

End-to-end deep learning has yield incredibly successful IR-based program representations beyond handcrafted features like Autophase. Future work should 
evaluate modern representations such as FAIR~\cite{niu2024} in the context of phase ordering.

\subsection{Model}

Instead of deep Q-learning, future work should investigate methods in the AlphaGo~\cite{silver2016} lineage such as AlphaZero~\cite{silver2018}, 
MuZero~\cite{schrittwieser2020}, MuZero Reanalyze~\cite{schrittwieser2021} and EfficientZero~\cite{ye2021} which offer superior sample efficiency.

\subsection{Objective}

IR instruction count minimization is not a particularly useful objective. It serves primarily as a mechanism to disambiguate between different methods for 
ordering optimization passes. However, the task might be saturated: most methods differ by less than a percentage point improvement over 
\texttt{-Oz}. Future work should incorporate more relevant and underexplored objectives such as runtime and energy consumption.
